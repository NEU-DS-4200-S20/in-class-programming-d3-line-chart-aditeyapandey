# Interactive D3 Line Chart

In this readme we provide you the source code of example we covered in the class. We have added a file called 'linechartinteractive.js' for implementing the interactive version.

The original 'linechart.js' is also available. We expect you to compare the two files to understand the differences between one and multi-line chart.
