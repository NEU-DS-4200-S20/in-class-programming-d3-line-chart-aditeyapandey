# Interactive D3 Line Chart

In this repo, we provide you the source code of example we covered in the class. We have added a file called 'linechartinteractive.js' for implementing the interactive version.

The original 'linechart.js' from the inclass assignment is also available. We expect you to compare the two files to understand the differences between single and multi-line chart visualizations.

There will some css changes, you can choose to ignore them for the interactivity feature.
